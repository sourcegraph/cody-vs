## Preview release

Follow these steps to publish a new preview to the [Private feed](https://sourcegraph.github.io/cody-vs/feed.xml).

1. **Create release branch**: Branch name must follow convention `vs-vMAJOR.MINOR.x` where MINOR must be even number `git checkout -b vs-vMAJOR.MINOR.x`. NOTE: Although the MINOR number will be even in the branch name the preview version of the extension will have an odd number (MINOR -1) 
2. **Start publication**: Go to https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody-vs/actions/workflows/publish.yml and run workflow manually using following parameters: 
    - Use workflow from: release branch
    - Publish type: Preview
