# Cody for Visual Studio

Cody for Visual Studio, an AI coding assistant that uses search and codebase context to help you understand, write, and fix code faster.

Install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-vs).

# AI that uses your codebase as context

[Cody](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody?utm_source=marketplace.visualstudio.com&utm_medium=referral) is an AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses advanced search to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your entire codebase at any scale, all from within VS Code. Plus, Cody Pro users can choose from the latest large language models—like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus—to customize Cody to their needs.

Install Cody to get started with free AI-powered chat, commands, and more.

## Chat

Answer questions about programming topics generally or your codebase specifically with Cody chat. Enable Cody to include Enhanced Context of your open project, or tag specific files and symbols to refine your chat prompt.

For example, you can ask Cody:

- "How is our app's secret storage implemented on Linux?"
- "Where is the CI config for the web integration tests?"
- "Write a new GraphQL resolver for the AuditLog"
- "Why is the UserConnectionResolver giving an "unknown user" error, and how do I fix it?"
- "Add helpful debug log statements"
- "Make this work" _(seriously, it often works—try it!)_


## Choose Your LLM

Cody Pro users can now select the LLM they want to use for chat and experiment to choose the best model for the job. Choose from Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, ChatGPT 4o, ChatGPT 4 Turbo, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Mixtral.

Administrators for Sourcegraph Enterprise instances can choose betweeen Claude and ChatGPT models to set for their teams as well.
