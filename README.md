# Cody for Visual Studio

[Cody for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-vs) is currently Experimental. [See the docs for more information](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/clients/install-visual-studio#installing-cody-in-visual-studio).

## AI that uses your codebase as context

[Cody](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody?utm_source=marketplace.visualstudio.com&utm_medium=referral) is an AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses advanced search to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your entire codebase at any scale, all from within VS Code. Plus, Cody Pro users can choose from the latest large language models—like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus—to customize Cody to their needs.

## Chat

Answer questions about programming topics generally or your codebase specifically with Cody chat. Enable Cody to include Enhanced Context of your open project, or tag specific files and symbols to refine your chat prompt.

For example, you can ask Cody:

- "How is our app's secret storage implemented on Linux?"
- "Where is the CI config for the web integration tests?"
- "Write a new GraphQL resolver for the AuditLog"
- "Why is the UserConnectionResolver giving an "unknown user" error, and how do I fix it?"
- "Add helpful debug log statements"
- "Make this work" _(seriously, it often works—try it!)_

## Choose Your LLM

Cody offers a variety of large language models (LLMs) to power your chat experience.
Cody Pro users can select the LLM they want to use for chat and experiment to choose the best model for the job. Choose from Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Mixtral, while Cody Free users have access to the latest base models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Mixtral.
Local models are also available through Ollama to both Cody Free and Cody Pro users. Simply download the model and run it in Ollama to use it in Cody chat.

Administrators for Sourcegraph Enterprise instances can choose between Claude and GPT models to set for their teams as well.

## Usage

This extension works for all Cody plans, including Cody Free, Cody Pro, and Cody Enterprise.

You can find detailed information about Cody's available plans [on our website](https://sourcegraph.com/pricing?utm_source=marketplace.visualstudio.com&utm_medium=referral).
